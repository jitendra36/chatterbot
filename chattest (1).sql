(' \nEnergy and its resources\nEmpirical principle of conservation of energy says that in an isolated system the sum of all types of energy is constant and does not change over time.\n So we can not create energy out of nothing, we can only change the type of energy present in the system (that is, make the conversion). Often w\ne do not realize that the concept of primary energy associated with the principle of conservation of energy - it is the energy in the primary energy\n carriers that come directly from nature. Only this energy is transformed into other, more useful to us form or energy products used in modern energy\n sector (electricity, thermal energy, mechanical energy).\nFor primary energy sources mainly include fossil fuels: hard coal, coking coal, brown coal, oil, natural gas,\n radioactive elements and peat. Departments of Mining and Geoengineering (WGiG), Drilling,\n Oil and Gas (WWNiG) and largely Geology, Geophysics and Environmental Protection (WGGiO?) conduct \nresearch and educate on how to recognize and to obtain the above-mentioned energy resources and their processing.\n Renewable energy sources, such as biomass (firewood, fuel solid waste plant and animal), wind, solar, geothermal\n heat and hydropower are also qualified group of primary energy. Issues related to the conversion of the energy \ncontained in fossil raw materials and derived from renewable sources and energy transport are the subject of \nresearch activity primarily the Department of Energy and Fuels (Weipa) and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering\n and Robotics (WIMiR) and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Engineering Biomedical (WEAIiIB).\nThe modern world economy characterized by steadily increasing demand for energy associated with the economic development of\n countries in many regions of the world; including densely populated areas of Asia (China, India), South America and Africa.\n At the same time, the more visible are the effects of depletion of fossil fuels, which is gaining more and more difficult -\n as a consequence of rising prices of raw materials on the world market, and thus energy prices processed. More and more attention\n is paid to the effects of the exploitation, processing and use of energy resources on the environment. Policies to prevent warming \nof the Earth''s climate as a result of CO2 emissions makes the use for energy purposes of coal and lignite will be associated with \nmore dolegliwymi restrictions.\nFor these reasons, you should expect in the near future with far-reaching changes in the conditions of production and technology used in\n the fuel and energy sector, in which the most important are:increased use of renewable energy sources;the growing role of natural gas \nin the energy system of the world and the resulting need to ensure its safe delivery based on local production (conventional and unconventional \ngas) or stable imports;development of energy technologies aimed at improving the efficiency of energy, particularly electricity generation;\nthe use of clean coal technologies, mainly focused on the separation of carbon dioxide from flue gases and its safe geological storage;\nAdvanced processing of primary fuels, including in particular the gasification of coal and biomass for energy purposes and the production\n of synthetic fuels and products for the chemical industry (polygeneration);the development of new energy technologies, including energy \nsuch as hydrogen and nuclear power, based not only on existing systems of nuclear reactors, but also the use of breeder reactors, high-temperature\n nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion; efficient energy management through its efficient distribution (the concept of smart grids so. smart grids),\n the use of trays (magazines) energy, energy management (Demand-Side Management) and the wider energy saving in industry and households, with \nparticular emphasis on energy-saving technologies industrial and building construction;utilization of industrial waste (solid and liquid) and \nutilities for energy purposes;the use of biochemical methods to the production of fuels (ethanol, biogas fermentation, hydrogen);need to \nsatisfy strict standards not only exhaust gas purification from sulfur compounds and CO2, but also nitrogen oxides and mercury compounds;\nextensive use of process modeling and optimization of energy systems for their actions;conducting energy policy aimed at ensuring energy security.\n It is expected that the changes that occur in the energy sector of our country will be consistent with the above mentioned processes,\n although the situation of Polish is special compared to the other members of the European Union.?\nOur country, as one of the few European countries have ensured a high energy security thanks to rich deposits of coal and lignite are within its territory. Favourable \n\nchanges to improve the energy security of the country can also occur when the meet is hope for the extraction of significant amounts of shale gas - the success of this \n\nproject would also facilitate important to make the necessary modernization of power plants and break the almost monopolistic position in the coal sector. Further, the \n\ndesired efforts towards sustainable energy development is the construction of nuclear power plants and a greater share of renewable energy in the energy balance of the \n\ncountry. This sector also requires others to enhance the efficiency of its operations, including modern technologies using coal without negative consequences for the \n\nenvironment and reconstruction of power grids. Extensive research conducted at the University of Science and Technology cover all the issues raised above. These \n\nstudies form the basis of the education of students - graduates of these studies will form the future, well-educated engineering staff, capable to meet the challenges \n\nfacing the country, the difficult problems threatening potential energy crisis."\n '),
(' Environmental and climate: \nEnvironment and climate changeWork in the field of environmental protection,\n climate change research, monitoring, prediction and constraints and adapt to these changes are one of the fastest growing areas\n of research and development of the Academy of Mining and Metallurgy. Stanislaus Technology in Cracow.\n These issues are an important part of scientific departments: Geology, Geophysics and Environmental Protection (WGGiO?)\n, Energy and Fuels (Weipa), Physics and Applied Informatics (WFiIS), Mining Surveying and Environmental Engineering (WGGiI?), Foundry (WO) and Drilling, Oil and Gas (WWNiG). Research conducted at AGH are a response to the growing demand economic and social in Poland and in the world, in\n connection with existing and emerging threats. An important feature is their fruitful cooperation with the Government of the Republic of Poland,\n European Union agencies, industry and non-governmental institutions. The problems associated with the effective use of the resource base of the \ncountry''s energy in terms of sustainable development lead to the development of research into the fuel resources in Poland and their proper use. \nIn the above subject matter also involves the study of experimental processes of sorption / desorption hard coals and sorbents minerals in terms \nof environmental protection, physical-chemical testing materials of carbon and inorganic combustion of natural gas with an oxidant niskoazotowym, \nthe use of layered silicates in adsorption and catalytic processes. Examined are also other mineral resources, as well as underground water sweet \nand mineral. An important area of activity of AGH employees are working in the field of renewable energy sources. An example of this type of \nresearch is geothermal energy, which includes work on the methodology to identify potential heat rock with technology implementation\n and operation of borehole heat exchangers. Research on environmental seek to determine the impact of industrial activity \n(in particular mining, metallurgy, oil, or casting) on the environment. Their goal is to develop new methods to reduce\n pollution in air, soil, surface water and groundwater. Monitored is also the environmental impact of municipal economy, tourism and \nother fields of human activity. Climate change research is conducted on the basis of geological and geophysical data, such as information\n stored in the trunks of trees, the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, glaciers, sediments at the bottoms of oceans, seas and lakes. For \npaleoklimatologa they replace the modern tools of measuring the climate, such as thermometers and tools to measure the amount of rainfall.\n Bada also other fossil indicators of climate coal, bauxite, iron oxides (red sludge \\"red beds\\"), evaporites, tility (fossil glacial moraines),\n fauna and flora of thermophilic. Systematic measurements of the concentrations of the main greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the atmosphere \nin Polish are conducted at the analytical level corresponding to the best laboratories worldwide. Scientists from the AGH participated \nin many research projects the European Union within the framework of 4, 5 and 6 of the framework Programme, related to the study of \nthe dynamics of the carbon cycle in the area of the European continent. Integrated carbon Observing System (ICOS) is a European \ninitiative in the framework of ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures). ICOS received fi nancing of the EU \non the preparatory phase of the system (2008-2012). it is expected that ICOS will operate for a period of 30 years and will \noperate on the basis of funds EU member states. Comparison of current measurement results with data paleoklimatycznymi enable\n more accurate calibration results and better predict future climate change. They will be based inter alia on existing and developed computer models.'),

('faculty  history : - The?idea to establish a?University of Mining with the?native lecture language appeared in Poland during the?partitioning period in the?XIX century. As a?result of the?many efforts of Polish mining engineers, the?Ministry of Public Work in Vienna notified the?Presiding City Board of Cracow of the?decision that a?mining engineering academy was to be opened in Cracow. The?university, nowadays The?University of Science and Technology of Stanis?aw Staszic, brought into existence according to resolution of the?cabinet on April 8, 1919.  The?Head of the?State, J?zef Pi?sudski, nominated six professors on May 1, 1919, and on October 20, 1919, he inaugurated the?Academy of Mining in the?hall of Collegium Novum of the?Jagiellonian University.  It was then, that he pronounced the?historical formula  I announce that The?University of Mining is open. In the?beginning, the?first lectures took place in buildings which belonged to different schools in Cracow. In June 1923, a?foundation stone was put into place to build a?main building. The?Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics is one of the?oldest and largest faculties at the?AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow.  It has been involved in research and education for over 50 years, educating outstanding researchers, engineers, academics and businessmen. The?beginning of the?Faculty dates back to 1952; the?idea to establish the?Faculty, however, is much older and was developed back in 1922,  when Prof. Jan Krauze submitted a?request to the?Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment to establish a?separate faculty of mechanics with two departments:  construction and mechanics.  Next, in 1926, the?General Assembly of Professors of the?Academy supported the?idea of establishing a?faculty of mechanics or electromechanics. The?rapid development of mechanics in the?Academy started after World War II. On 8 January 1946, two new faculties began operations at the?Academy, including the?Faculty of Electromechanics, organised by Prof. Jan Krauze,  who also became the?first Dean of the?Faculty.  The?Faculty staff included renowned academics representing different fields of mechanics, For the?outstanding academic ? Prof. Maksymilian Tytus Hubert ? the?Department of Advanced Mechanics was established. Graduates from the?Faculty at that time, depending on their educational profile, received either the?title of Master of Science in Mechanics or Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. In 1952, the?Faculty of Electromechanics was divided into the?Faculty of Electrification of Mining and Metallurgy and the?Faculty of Mechanisation of Mining and Metallurgy. The?B?2 Pavilion, opened in 1953, together with the?engine?house, as well as the?pre?war Machine Laboratory building became the?main educational and research quarters for the?Faculty.  In the?first year of its operations, 403 people studied at the?Faculty of Mechanisation of Mining and Metallurgy. The?1957/58 academic year saw a?number of organisational changes at the?Academy. The?Faculty was renamed the?Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy Machines.  Moreover, new units were established: the?Department of the?History of Technology and Technical Sciences and the?Department of Mineral Processing Machines. Furthermore, two consultation centres were established, in Olkusz and Kielce.  The?latter evolved into the?College of Engineering,  and next into the?Kielce University of Technology.  At the?same time the?number of students at the?Faculty of Mining and Metallurgy Machines also increased. In the?1964/65 academic year, already 1355 students attended the?Faculty (of which 471 studied in extramural and evening classes). The?number of students and staff at the?Faculty has been increasing systematically. Increasingly more scientific and research projects have been implemented for use in industry.  Educational and laboratory support facilities have been developed, mainly through the?modernisation of buildings, lecture halls and research laboratories. The?Faculty is also fully equipped with computer equipment and access to the?Internet. Our strong position is based, inter alia, on: outstanding academic staff (over 200 academic teachers), high quality of research projects, publications and patents ? totalling 42 in the?past four years, proper research and educational support facilities (3 pavilions and a?technology hall with rare laboratory and measuring equipment),  as well as a?modern educational system. The?Faculty has awarded a?large number of academic and professional degrees, thus proving its significance. To date 150 persons have obtained the?title of doctor habilitatus, whilst nearly 500 obtained the?title of doctor in technical sciences.  We also have thousands of graduates with the?title of Master of Science in Mechanics. Our graduates work in a?wide variety of fields and specialisations in industry and achieve professional success thanks to the?knowledge and qualifications gained during their studies.  Numerous national and international awards, as well as honorary titles also attest to the?research and educational achievements of the?Faculty''s staff. The?Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics has also developed wide cooperation with various research and educational institutions,  as well as industry concerns in Poland (inter alia: Polish Academy of Science, State Committee for Scientific Research, KGHM Polska Mied? S.A., DELPHI Automotive Systems, Siemens, Mitsubishi Electric) and abroad (inter alia: Clausthal University, ICAM (Nantes, Lille, Toulouse), University of Nottingham, Chicago State University). '),
('   Cooperation:-  AGH cooperates closely with other universities, the economy and the state administration and local government. AGH interested in a common organizational initiatives, such as research centers, technology development centers, laboratories and other intercollegiate. Committed to the development of inter-study, including a new, interdisciplinary study programs and intercollegiate and international doctoral studies. The AGH since 2011 operates the Centre for International Technology Promotion and Education AGH-UNESCO, which is the first Polish unit under the auspices of UNESCO, inspiring and coordinating and supporting the exchange and transfer of knowledge and engineering practice and education at the university level in the field of technical sciences in the international dimension particularly addressed to developing countries. The Centre AGH-UNESCO are part of the priorities of UNESCO and the AGH and are addressed to partners worldwide.'),
('Research and implementation :-  The innovative potential of AGH is expressed in the dimension of intellectual property, which includes patents, trademarks,  utility models and inventive projects.  In order to create mechanisms to facilitate and intensify the transfer of innovative technologies and knowledge  from AGH to companies and other external institutions established Technology Transfer Centre at AGH.'),
(' Laboratories and equipment :-  Product research equipment and laboratories Laboratories accredited by PCAResearch Laboratory Products Properties of Rocks and Stone No. AB 298Laboratory of Building Materials and Ceramic No. AB 619 Structural Research Laboratory No. AB 1445 Research Laboratory Technical Means of Transport and Materials No. AB 771, Laboratory Hydrogeochemical No. AB 1050. Measurement lab?Place of publication of research results is used in universities measure their level studio. The results of tests performed in laboratories AGH are published in the best journals worldwide.  In addition to research laboratories in AGH also they operate laboratories, technological and scientific nature of the service. The University has more than 700 laboratories. On the way to academic success is an essential tool for modern equipment, which is a key support for research. Examples in this regard may be the most powerful in this part of Europe microscopes to study the structure of metal, or the so-called rigid testing machine, allowing precisely examine critical for safe mining processes of cracking and crushing rocks, electron microscopes,  equipment for complex testing of solids, and in particular their area, mass spectrometers, a number of environmental testing equipment, etc.  singletons in the world are one of the few most powerful in the world - an analytical transmission electron microscope (S) TEM FEI TitanCubed G-2 60-300, as well as X-ray fluorescence confocal microscope. Technologies in the team clean rooms, so-called. clean room, allows the generation of nanostructures, which even minor contamination is very critical technology. On the other hand, electron microprobe Jeol SuperProbe allows you to specify the content of elements from boron to uranium in all kinds of solids.  The AGH is also the Experimental Mine - a unique laboratory research and teaching and the anechoic chamber, which is one of the quietest places in Poland.  In addition, the refrigerator diluents which can achieve temperatures of several thousandths of a Kelvin above absolute zero,  and is one of the coldest places in Europe. The structure of AGH also operates Academic Computer Centre CYFRONET,  which is the leading unit in the operation and expansion of the urban network (MAN) and the operation of computers high performance computing (HPC).  The center provides services to science, particularly in the field of computer networks, computing power and other services. Cyfronet supports researchers by sharing computing power of supercomputers - among them is Prometheus - the fastest supercomputer in Polish history, which is one of the largest installations of this type in the world and also the first in Europe, based on the latest technology for direct liquid cooling.');
